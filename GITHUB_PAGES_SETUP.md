# 🌐 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

I've created a beautiful static website for your IoT Device Identification System that will work perfectly on GitHub Pages!

## 🎉 What I've Created for You:

✅ **Static HTML Website** - Beautiful, responsive design
✅ **Interactive Demo Interface** - Shows how your system works
✅ **Sample Predictions Display** - Real-looking confidence scores
✅ **Device Categories Showcase** - All 9 supported device types

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup:

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/bhushan/Desktop/SE_Project_1
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages static site"
git push origin main
```

**Note**: You'll need to use your Personal Access Token as the password.

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/bhushancharpe15/iot-device-identification/settings/pages

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - **Source**: "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: "main"
   - **Folder**: "/static_site" (this is important!)
   - **Click "Save"**

3. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Your Website is Live! 🎉

## 🎯 Why Static vs Dynamic?

**GitHub Pages Limitation**: GitHub Pages only supports static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), not server-side applications like Flask.

**My Solution**: I created a beautiful static showcase that:
- ✅ Demonstrates your project's capabilities

- ✅ Provides links to the full interactive version
- ✅ Looks professional and engaging
- ✅ Loads fast and works everywhere

## 🔧 Customization Options:

### Change Content:
- Edit `static_site/index.html` for text changes
- Modify the CSS in the `<style>` section
- Update JavaScript in the `<script>` section

### Add More Features:
- Add more sample predictions
- Include screenshots of the full app
- Add video demonstrations
- Include more technical details

### Styling Changes:
- Modify colors in the CSS variables
- Change fonts or layouts
- Add more animations
- Customize the design

## 📈 Benefits of This Approach:

1. **Free Hosting** - Completely free on GitHub Pages
2. **Fast Loading** - Optimized for speed
3. **Global CDN** - Fast worldwide access
4. **HTTPS** - Secure by default
5. **Easy Updates** - Just push changes to GitHub
6. **Professional Look** - Great for portfolios
7. **Mobile Friendly** - Works on all devices

## 🎨 Your Static Site Features:

2. Wait a few minutes for deployment
3. Check the Actions tab for any errors
4. Make sure the branch is "main"

### If you want to make changes:
