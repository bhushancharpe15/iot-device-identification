# 🚀 Manual GitHub Setup - Step by Step

I've prepared everything for you! Just follow these simple steps:

## ✅ What I've Already Done:
- ✅ Initialized Git repository
- ✅ Added all your files to Git
- ✅ Created initial commit
- ✅ Prepared all deployment files
- ✅ Updated documentation with your username

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `iot-device-identification`
3. **Description**: `Advanced IoT Device Identification System using XGBoost and Flask`
4. **Make it PUBLIC** ✅
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" ❌
6. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Get Your Repository URL
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands. Look for:
```
https://github.com/bhushancharpe15/iot-device-identification.git
```

### Step 3: Connect and Push (Run these commands)
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /home/bhushan/Desktop/SE_Project_1

# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/bhushancharpe15/iot-device-identification.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub (you'll need to enter your GitHub username and password/token)
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: When prompted for username, enter: `bhushancharpe15`
**Note**: For password, use a GitHub Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

### Step 4: Create Personal Access Token (if needed)
If you get authentication errors:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "IoT Project"
4. Select "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it as your password

## 🎉 Success!
Once completed, your repository will be live at:
**https://github.com/bhushancharpe15/iot-device-identification**
